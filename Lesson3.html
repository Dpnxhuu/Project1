          A nested list in HTML is a list that contains another list within one
          of its list items. This is a powerful way to create a hierarchical or
          multi-level structure for your content. The key to creating a nested
          list is to place the child list {either <<strong>ul</strong>> or
          <<strong>ol</strong>> } inside a <<strong>li</strong>> element of the
          parent list.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, you could have an unordered list of "Courses" and within
          a list item for "Web Development," you could nest another ordered list
          for "HTML," "CSS," and "JavaScript". This structure makes the
          relationship between the items clear and is commonly used for things
          like navigation menus and outlines.

          Nested Lists A nested list in HTML is a list that contains another
          list within one of its list items. This is a powerful way to create a

          creating a nested list is to place the child list (either
          <<strong>ul</strong>> or <<strong>ol</strong>> ) inside a
          <<strong>li</strong>> element of the parent list. For example, you
          could have an unordered list of "Courses" and within a list item for
          "Web Development," you could nest another ordered list for "HTML,"
          "CSS," and "JavaScript." This structure makes the relationship between
          the items clear and is commonly used for things like navigation menus
          and outlines. It is important to remember that the nested list should
          be a child of a list item <<strong>li</strong>> and not a direct child
          of the parent list {<<strong>ul</strong>> or <<strong>ol</strong>> }.
          This is a common mistake and will cause validation errors and
          unpredictable rendering.

        <p>
          HTML tables are used to present tabular data, which is information
          organized in a two-dimensional grid of rows and columns. They are
          designed for data that would be suitable for a spreadsheet, such as
          financial reports, schedules, or product comparisons.
        </p>
        <p>
          The basic structure of an HTML table consists of the (table) element,
          which acts as the main container. Inside the table, you use
          <<strong>tr</strong>> elements to define table rows. Within each row,
          <<strong>th</strong>> elements are used for table headers (which are
          usually bold and centered by default) and <<strong>td</strong>>
          elements are used for standard table data cells.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tables can also include more complex elements like
          <<strong>thead</strong>>, <<strong>tbody</strong>>, and
          <<strong>tfoot</strong>> to semantically group the header, body, and
          footer of the table. You can also use the <strong>colspan</strong> and
          <strong>rowspan</strong> attributes on <<strong>th</strong>> or
          <<strong>td</strong>> elements to make a single cell span across
          multiple columns or rows, which is useful for creating more complex
          layouts within the table.
