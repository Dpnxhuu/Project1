        <legend><h2>The Input Element: The Box for Your Stuff</h2></legend>
        <p>
          This is the most common form tag. It's a self-closing tag that creates
          an input field. Its behavior changes based on its <strong>type</strong> attribute. The
          most basic type is text.
        </p>
        <img src="./input.png" alt="input code png" width="520px" />
        <br />
        <form>
          <input type="text" />

          <h2>The Need for Meaning - The label</h2>
        </legend>
        <p>
          The Problem: We have a box, but the user has no idea what they are
          supposed to type into it. Is it for a name? An email? A search query?
          The box is meaningless without a description.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Solution: We need to add a descriptive piece of text. The correct
          HTML tag for this is the <strong>label</strong>. It's a tag
          specifically designed to be the title for a form field.
        </p>
        <strong>Let's add a label:</strong>
        <br>
        <img src="./label.png" alt="label code img" width="540px" />
        <br />
        <label>First Name:</label>
        <input type="text" />

        <p>
          <strong>Result:</strong> This is better! Now the user sees "First
          Name:" next to the box and knows what to type. But the label and the
          input are still two completely separate, unrelated things. The browser
          doesn't know they belong together
        </p>
      </fieldset>

      <br />
      <fieldset>
        <legend><h2>The Need for Connection - id and for</h2></legend>
        <p>
          The Problem: How can we create a direct, unbreakable link between the
          label "First Name:" and its specific input box? We need this for two
          reasons:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Usability: It would be great if a user could click on the text of
            the label to activate the input box.
          </li>
          <li>
            Accessibility: Screen readers for visually impaired users need to
            know which label describes which input so they can announce it
            correctly.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The Solution: We need a unique naming system.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            First, we give our input box a unique name that no other element on
            the page has. The attribute for a unique name is id. Let's give it
            an id of "firstName".
          </li>
          <li>
            Next, we tell the label which element it is for. The for attribute
            on the label must match the id of the input.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <strong>Let's connect them:</strong>
        <br>
        <img src="./Id and for .png" alt="id/for code" width="540px" />
        <br />
        <label for="firstName">First Name:</label>
        <input type="text" id="firstName" />
        <p><strong>Result:</strong> We have now created a powerful, explicit connection.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Try it: If you click on the text "First Name:", your cursor will
            magically jump into the text box.
          </li>
          <li>
            Behind the scenes: A screen reader will now announce, "First Name,
            edit text" when the user focuses on the input box. The two elements
            are now a true pair.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </fieldset>

      <br />
      <fieldset>
        <legend><h2>The Need for Submission - The form and submit</h2></legend>
        <p>
          The Problem: We have a field for the user to fill out, but we have no
          way for them to actually <em>submit</em> this information. We need a
          container for our fields and a "Go" button.
        </p>
        <p>The Solution:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            We wrap all our form fields in a form tag. This tag acts as the main
            container that tells the browser, "Everything inside here is part of
            one single submission."
          </li>
          <li>
            We add a button that tells the form to submit. The simplest way is
            input type="submit".
          </li>
        </ol>
        <strong>Let's build the form structure:</strong>
        <br>
        <img src="./submit.png" alt="submit code png" width="540px" />
        <br />

        <form>
          <label for="firstName">First Name:</label>
          <input type="text" id="firstName" />

          <br /><br />
          <label for="lastName">Last Name:</label>
          <input type="text" id="lastName" />

          <br /><br />

          <input type="submit" />
        </form>
        <p>
          <strong>Result:</strong>We now have a complete visual form with two
          fields and a submit button. When you click the button, the page
          reloads, but the data doesn't go anywhere yet.
        </p>
      </fieldset>

      <br />
      <fieldset>
        <legend>
          <h2>The Need for Data Identification - The name Attribute</h2>
        </legend>
        <p>
          The Problem: When the form is submitted, the browser needs to package
          the data to send to a server. How does it label the data? If a user
          types "Arjun" in the first box, how does the server know that "Arjun"
          is themfirstName? The <strong>id</strong> attribute is only for use within the page; it
          is not sent to the server.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Solution: We need another attribute whose sole purpose is to be
          the "data label" or the "key" for the submitted value. This is
          the name attribute.
        </p>
        <strong>Let's add names to our inputs:</strong>
        <br>
        <img src="./Name.png" alt="name attribute img" width="540px" />
        <br />

        <form>
          <label for="firstName">First Name:</label>
          <input type="text" id="firstName" name="firstName" />

          <br /><br />

          <label for="lastName">Last Name:</label>
          <input type="text" id="lastName" name="lastName" />

          <br /><br />

          <input type="submit" />
        </form>
        <p>
          <strong>Result:</strong> Now we have a truly functional form, ready to send meaningful
          data. When submitted, the browser will create a package that looks
          like this:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>firstName = (whatever the user typed)</li>
            <li>lastName = (whatever the user typed)</li>
        </ul>
