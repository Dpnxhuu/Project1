        <h3>Step 1: The First Principle (The Fundamental Truth)</h3>
        <p>
          The most fundamental truth is this: A website is not one single file.
          It's a collection of different files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images,
          videos, fonts) that all need to work together. These files are
          organized into folders, just like documents on your computer.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 2: The Core Problem</h3>
        <p>
          Now we have a core problem: If your index.html file needs to display
          an image named logo.png, how does the HTML file tell the browser where
          to find logo.png? You can't just say src="logo.png" and expect it to
          work every time. What if the logo is in an images folder? What if it's
          on a completely different website? The browser needs an exact,
          unambiguous address to locate the file. A file path is that address.
        </p>
        <h3>A. Relative File Paths (The Most Important for Your Projects)</h3>
        <p>
          A relative file path gives directions to a file starting from the
          location of the file you are currently in. You will use this 99% of
          the time for linking your own files together (images, CSS, other HTML
          pages).
        </p>
        <img
          src="./relative path.png"
          alt="Relative path example"
          width="700px"
        />
        <p>Here are the different scenarios:</p>
        <ul type="none">
          <li>
            <strong>Scenario 1:</strong> Linking to a file in the SAME folder.
          </li>
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>
              The Problem: You are in index.html and want to link to about.html.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Logic: They are neighbors, living in the same my-website/
              folder. The directions are as simple as possible
            </li>
            <li>The Syntax: You just use the filename.</li>
            <img
              src="./scenario 1.png"
              alt="relative path example"
              width="720px"
            />
          </ul>
          <li>Scenario 2: Linking to a file in a SUB-FOLDER (Going Down).</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The Problem: You are in <u>index.html</u> and want to display
              logo.png.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Logic: From <u>index.html</u>, you need to go into the images
              folder to find the logo.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Syntax: You write the folder name, a forward slash/, and then
              the filename.codeHtml
            </li>
            <img
              src="./scenario 2.png"
              alt="relative path scenario 2"
              width="720px"
            />
          </ul>
        </ul>

        <h3>B. Absolute File Paths</h3>
        <p>
          An absolute file path gives the full, complete URL to a resource on
          the web. It starts with <u>http:// or https://.</u>
        </p>

        <ul>
          <p>
            When to use it: <br />
            You ONLY use absolute paths when you are linking to a resource that
            is NOT on your own website.
          </p>
          <li>Linking to another website.</li>
          <li>Using a font from Google Fonts.</li>
          <li>Using an image from an image-hosting service.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <img
          src="./absolute path.png"
          alt="absolute path example"
          width="720px"
        />
        <br /><br />

        <strong
          ><mark>Note:</mark> The Critical "Why": Why not use absolute paths for
          your own files?</strong
        >
        <p>
          A beginner might be tempted to copy the full path from their computer,
          like this: src="C:/Users/Arjun/Desktop/my-website/images/logo.png"
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a major mistake. This address only works on your computer. The
          moment you upload your website to a real web server, that path becomes
          meaningless and the image will be broken.
        </p>

        <legend><h2>2.HTML Boilerplate Code</h2></legend>
        <h3>Step 1: The First Principle (The Fundamental Truth)</h3>
        <p>
          The fundamental truth is that a web browser is a program that needs
          specific, predictable instructions to do its job. It cannot guess your
          intentions. You can't just give it a file with a <<strong>h1</strong>>
          tag and expect it to know what kind of document it is, what language
          it's in, or how to render it properly.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 2: The Core Problem</h3>
        <p>
          We need a way to give the browser essential "setup information" before
          it starts rendering our visible content (like paragraphs and images).
          This setup information needs to answer critical questions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            "What version of HTML am I reading?" (So I know which rules to
            follow).
          </li>
          <li>
            "What character encoding should I use?" (So characters like ©, or ₹
            are displayed correctly and not as gibberish like â€™).
          </li>
          <li>"What should the title of the browser tab be?"</li>
          <li>
            "How should this page behave on a mobile device vs. a desktop?"
          </li>
          <p>Just writing "Hello" doesn't answer any of these questions.</p>
        </ul>
        <h3>Step 3: The Logical Solution - The Boilerplate</h3>
        <p>
          The solution is to create a standard, universal starting template—a
          boilerplate. This is a block of code that you will start every single
          HTML file with. It's not something you need to reinvent each time; you
          just copy-paste it and fill in the blanks. It's the "blueprint of the
          house" that you need before you can start putting in the walls
          <strong>h1</strong> and windows <strong>img</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>Let's build the modern HTML5 boilerplate from first principles:</p>
        <strong>The Anatomy of the HTML Boilerplate</strong>
        <br />
        <img
          src="./boilerplate code.png"
          alt="boilerplate code img"
          width="720px"
        />
        <p>Let's break down each line and explain why it's necessary.</p>
        <ol>
          <strong><li>!DOCTYPE html:</li></strong>
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>
              The Problem: In the past, there were many versions of HTML (HTML4,
              XHTML, etc.). The browser needed to know which set of rules to use
              to render the page.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Solution: This is the very first line and it's called the
              Document Type Declaration. In modern HTML5, it's incredibly
              simple. This specific line tells the browser: "Use the latest,
              standard-compliant mode for rendering this HTML document." It's a
              switch that prevents the browser from falling back into "quirks
              mode" (an old mode for rendering non-standard pages). It must
              always be the first thing in your file.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <strong> <li>html lang="en":</li></strong>
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>
              The Problem: The web is global. How do search engines (like
              Google) and screen readers (for accessibility) know what human
              language the content is written in?
            </li>
            <li>
              The Solution: This is the root element that wraps your entire
              page. The lang="en" attribute declares that the primary language
              of the page content is English. This is very important for
              accessibility and SEO. You'd change "en" to "es" for Spanish, "hi"
              for Hindi, etc.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <strong> <li>Head:</li></strong>
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>
              The Problem: As discussed, we need a place to put all the
              "behind-the-scenes" information that is for the browser, not for
              the user to see on the page.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Solution: The <strong>head</strong> section is the container
              for this metadata. Nothing you put inside the
              <strong>head</strong> will be displayed in the main browser
              window.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <strong><li>meta charset="UTF-8":</li></strong>
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>
              The Problem: Computers fundamentally only understand numbers. To
              display text, they use a "character set" to map numbers to
              letters. There are many different character sets, and if the
              browser uses the wrong one, your text will be garbled.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Solution: This meta tag explicitly tells the browser to use
              UTF-8, which is the universal standard character set for the web.
              It can represent almost any character and symbol from any language
              in the world. This line is essential to prevent text-encoding
              issues.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <strong> <li>meta name="viewport":</li></strong>
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>
              The Problem: A website can be viewed on a tiny phone screen or a
              giant desktop monitor. If you don't tell a mobile browser how to
              handle your page, it will try to render it as if it were on a
              desktop—resulting in a tiny, zoomed-out, unreadable page.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Solution: This specific meta tag is the cornerstone of
              responsive design.
            </li>
            <ul type="circle">
              <li>
                width=device-width: This tells the browser: "Make the page's
                width equal to the screen width of the device it's being viewed
                on."
              </li>
              <li>
                initial-scale=1.0: This sets the initial zoom level to 100% when
                the page is first loaded.
              </li>
              <li>
                In simple terms: this line tells the browser to render the page
                in a way that is optimized for mobile screens.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <strong><li>title:</li></strong>
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>
              The Problem: A user might have 20 tabs open. How do they identify
              your page? What name should appear when they bookmark your page?
            </li>
            <li>
              The Solution: The title tag sets the text that appears in the
              browser tab, in bookmark lists, and in search engine results. It's
              a critical piece of metadata for both usability and SEO.
            </li>

          <strong><li>body:</li></strong>
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>The Problem: Where do we put the actual visible content?</li>
            <li>
              The Solution: The body section is the container for everything the
              user will actually see on the page: your headings, paragraphs,
              images, links, tables, etc. All the tags you've learned so far go
              inside the body.

        <h3>The Logical Solution: Two Types of Labels</h3>
        <p>
          The logical solution is to invent two types of labels (which we call
          attributes) that you can add to any HTML tag.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            A Unique Identifier: We need a label for one, and only one, specific
            element on the entire page. It must be unique. This is perfect for
            major, one-of-a-kind layout sections like the main navigation bar or
            a search form. This is the id.
          </li>
          <li>
            A Reusable Classifier: We also need a label that we can apply to
            multiple elements to group them into a category. This is for things
            that have a similar style or function, like all the profile cards,
            all the error messages, or all the "buy now" buttons. This is the
            class.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Analogy:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            An <strong>id</strong> is like a person's unique Social Security
            Number or Aadhaar Number. Only one person can have it.
          </li>
          <li>
            A <strong>class</strong> is like a person's Job Title (e.g.,
            "Engineer"). Many people in a company can have the class "Engineer".
          </li>
